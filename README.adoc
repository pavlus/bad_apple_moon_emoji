(thank you, link:https://github.com/folex[@folex])

And that's how idea was born.


=== Installation
. Install link:https://processing.org/download[Processing 3]
. Open the `bad_apple_emoji.pde` file in *Processing 3* and press btn:[▶] button (or kbd:[Ctrl+R])
. Change it! You can play around with output size, tile size, select one of
two available emoji themes, or get creative and write some more code!

=== How it works
. Split frame into tiles. Each tile will have a single emoji.
. For each tile:
[arabic]
.. Split tiles horizontally into 4 vertical regions.
.. Average each region color, calculate it's brightness, and check if it crosses threshold.
.. Calculate _perceptual hash_ of the tile: set corresponding to the region bits in range 0:3 to 1 if the region is brighter than the defined threshold and 0 if it's darker.
.. Lookup image from table that matches such hash (table constructed manually, with approximations)
.. Draw corresponding image at the current tile.
